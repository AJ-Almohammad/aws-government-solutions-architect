# Security Architecture Design - Department of Citizen Services

## Security Architecture Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture for the Department 
of Citizen Services cloud infrastructure, designed to meet and exceed FedRAMP 
Moderate baseline requirements, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and federal 
government security standards.

## Defense in Depth Strategy

### Multi-Layer Security Model
Our security architecture implements a defense-in-depth approach with seven 
distinct security layers:

1. **Perimeter Security** - Edge protection and DDoS mitigation
2. **Network Security** - VPC isolation and network access controls  
3. **Host Security** - Operating system and application hardening
4. **Application Security** - Secure coding and runtime protection
5. **Data Security** - Encryption and data loss prevention
6. **Identity Security** - Authentication and access management
7. **Monitoring Security** - Threat detection and incident response

## Perimeter Security Controls
