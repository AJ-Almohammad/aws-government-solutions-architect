# High-Level System Architecture - Department of Citizen Services

## Architecture Overview

This document presents the high-level architecture for the Department of 
Citizen Services cloud modernization project, designed to handle 
1,000-10,000 concurrent users with government-grade security and 
compliance.

### Architecture Components

1. **Edge & Content Delivery Layer**
   - CloudFront CDN: Global content delivery with edge caching
   - AWS WAF: Protection against common web exploits and DDoS
   - Route 53: DNS management with health checks and failover

2. **Load Balancing & Routing**
   - Application Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple AZs
   - Auto Scaling Groups: Automatic capacity management based on demand
   - Target Groups: Health check and traffic routing configuration

3. **Compute Layer**
   - EC2 Web Servers: Frontend application hosting with auto-scaling
   - EC2 Application Servers: Business logic processing tier
   - Lambda Functions: Serverless processing for event-driven tasks
   - Bastion Host: Secure administrative access to private resources

4. **API & Integration Layer**
   - API Gateway: RESTful API management with authentication and rate 
limiting
   - Lambda Integration: Serverless backend processing
   - External API Support: Partner agency system integration

5. **Data Management Layer**
   - RDS PostgreSQL: Primary transactional database with Multi-AZ 
deployment
   - Read Replicas: Improved read performance and disaster recovery
   - ElastiCache Redis: Session management and application caching
   - S3 Storage: Document storage with lifecycle management

6. **Security & Compliance Layer**
   - IAM: Identity and access management with least privilege
   - KMS: Encryption key management for data protection
   - CloudTrail: Comprehensive API audit logging
   - GuardDuty: AI-powered threat detection and monitoring
   - Security Hub: Centralized security findings and compliance dashboard

7. **Monitoring & Operations**
   - CloudWatch: Metrics, logs, and automated responses
   - X-Ray: Distributed tracing for performance optimization
   - SNS: Notification services for alerts and communications
   - Systems Manager: Configuration management and patch automation

## Scalability & Performance Design

### Auto Scaling Configuration
- Web Tier: 2-20 instances based on CPU and request count
- Application Tier: 2-15 instances based on custom metrics
- Database: Read replicas scale from 1-5 based on read load
- Caching: ElastiCache cluster auto-scaling enabled

### Performance Optimizations
- CDN Caching: 24-hour cache for static content
- Database Optimization: Query optimization and connection pooling
- Application Caching: Redis for session and frequently accessed data
- Load Balancing: Weighted routing based on instance capacity

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Current State vs. Optimized Architecture

| Component | Current Monthly Cost | Optimized Cost | Savings |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Compute   | $25,000           | $15,000        | $10,000 |
| Storage   | $18,000           | $12,000        | $6,000  |
| Database  | $15,000           | $8,000         | $7,000  |
| Network   | $10,000           | $6,200         | $3,800  |
| **TOTAL** | $68,000           | $41,200        | $27,200 |

### Cost Optimization Techniques
- Reserved Instances: 70% coverage for predictable workloads
- Spot Instances: 30% of auto-scaling capacity for fault-tolerant tasks
- S3 Intelligent Tiering: Automatic cost optimization for storage
- CloudFront: Reduced origin server load and bandwidth costs
- Auto Scaling: Right-sizing based on actual demand

## Compliance & Security Controls

### FedRAMP Moderate Controls Implemented
- Access Control (AC): 25 controls implemented
- Audit and Accountability (AU): 15 controls implemented
- Configuration Management (CM): 12 controls implemented
- Identification and Authentication (IA): 11 controls implemented
- System and Communications Protection (SC): 45 controls implemented

### Monitoring & Compliance Dashboard
- Real-time compliance scoring
- Automated control validation
- Exception reporting and remediation tracking
- Executive dashboard for compliance metrics

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

- **ADR-001: Multi-AZ Deployment**  
  Decision: Deploy across 3 Availability Zones in primary region  
  Rationale: Ensures 99.99% availability requirement and fault tolerance  
  Impact: Higher cost but meets government reliability standards

- **ADR-002: PostgreSQL over MySQL**  
  Decision: Use Amazon RDS PostgreSQL as primary database  
  Rationale: Better compliance features, advanced security, JSON support  
  Impact: Slightly higher cost but better government feature alignment

- **ADR-003: Hybrid Compute Strategy**  
  Decision: EC2 for web/app tiers, Lambda for event processing  
  Rationale: Balances performance predictability with cost optimization  
  Impact: Complex architecture but optimal cost and performance
