- Return on investment (ROI)
- Operating expense management
- Resource utilization efficiency

**Key Requirements:**
- Monthly budget cap: $50,000
- Cost transparency and reporting
- Reserved instance optimization
- Automated cost alerts

### 4. David Thompson - Operations Manager
**Primary Concerns:**

- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Maintenance windows and procedures
- Staff training and documentation

**Key Requirements:**
- 4-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- 1-hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Automated backup procedures
- 24/7 monitoring and alerting

## Business Requirements

### Current State Challenges
- Legacy on-premises infrastructure (10+ years old)
- Manual scaling requiring 2-week lead time
- Limited disaster recovery (24-48 hour RTO)
- High maintenance costs ($68,000/month)
- Security compliance gaps (65% manual verification)
- Limited monitoring visibility (40% system coverage)

### Desired Future State
- Cloud-native, auto-scaling architecture
- Sub-5-minute scaling response time
- Comprehensive disaster recovery (4-hour RTO max)
- Optimized costs (target: 40% reduction)
- Full compliance automation (95%+ coverage)
- Complete system observability (100% monitoring)

## Functional Requirements

### Core Application Features
- Citizen application submission portal
- Document upload and processing (PDF, images)
- Application status tracking
- Automated notifications (email, SMS)
- Administrative dashboard
- Reporting and analytics

### Integration Requirements
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with government ID system
- Payment processing integration
- Document verification services
- External API access for partner agencies
- Data export capabilities

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms
- Concurrent users: 1,000-10,000
- Peak load handling: 300% capacity increase
- Database query performance: < 100ms

### Security Requirements
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing quarterly
- Vulnerability scanning weekly

### Compliance Requirements
- FedRAMP Moderate baseline
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- SOC 2 Type II compliance
- FISMA compliance
- State privacy regulations

## Success Criteria
1. **Cost Reduction:** Achieve 40% reduction in monthly infrastructure costs
2. **Performance:** Meet all response time requirements under peak load
3. **Security:** Pass all compliance audits with 95%+ scores
4. **Reliability:** Achieve 99.99% uptime SLA
5. **Scalability:** Handle 300% load increase without manual intervention

## Project Timeline

- Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (2 weeks)
- Phase 3: Security Implementation (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Application Deployment (2 weeks)
- Phase 5: Monitoring & Optimization (2 weeks)
- Phase 6: DR & Compliance (2 weeks)

## Budget Allocation
- Infrastructure: $35,000/month
- Security & Compliance: $8,000/month
- Monitoring & Management: $4,000/month
- Disaster Recovery: $3,000/month
- **Total Budget:** $50,000/month
